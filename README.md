# Processing-Projects-Source

This repo contains the processing.js source code for all the projects available on my website. Each folder contains one .pde file, and some may contain a data folder which contains the images used by the sketch or its description. To run one of these programs yourself, it's best to paste it into the Processing IDE. Then, you will likely need to replace the size() call in setup, import and change the URLs of images and fonts to be loaded, and occasionally fix a few other errors that may pop up.
